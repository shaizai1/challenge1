# Code Refactor Challenge
This project is an exercise in learning about accessibility in web development, mainly through the use of semantic HTML and the alt attribute. I have been using semantic HTML to refactor existing code for a marketing webpage, in order to meet accesibility requirements. I have learned a lot about semantic HTML during the making of this project. It has also given me much more confidence in styling webpages using CSS.
